# üß† LML Backend Development Status & Roadmap

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - PHASE 1 & 2: MONGODB FOUNDATION**

### **Phase 1: Schema & Validation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)**
- **‚úÖ Deterministic Seat IDs**: SHA-256 hashes (`layoutId_section_row_number`)
- **‚úÖ Coordinate System**: Normalized 0-1 x,y coordinates for rendering
- **‚úÖ Layout Classification**: `seated`, `standing`, `hybrid` types  
- **‚úÖ Viewport Metadata**: Canvas configuration with units (`relative` | `px`)
- **‚úÖ MongoDB JSON Schema**: Database-level validation and constraints
- **‚úÖ TypeScript Types**: Production-grade type safety with enums

### **Phase 2: Immutability & Publishing (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)**
- **‚úÖ Hash Validation**: Prevents silent mutations between publish and deploy
- **‚úÖ Status Workflow**: `draft ‚Üí published ‚Üí deployed` with enforcement
- **‚úÖ CDN Publishing**: Mock implementation ready for S3/CloudFront
- **‚úÖ Automated Backups**: Pre-publish and pre-deploy with retention policies
- **‚úÖ Immutability Guards**: Published/deployed layouts fully protected
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with detailed violation reporting

---

## ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED: CDN INTEGRATION**

### **What's Ready But Paused**
- **CDN Publisher**: Full mock implementation in `publishing/cdn-publisher.ts`
- **S3/CloudFront Integration**: Architecture complete, awaiting live implementation
- **Signed URLs**: Mock generation ready for production
- **Cache Invalidation**: Strategy defined but not implemented
- **Global Distribution**: Framework ready for multi-region deployment

### **Why Paused**
- MongoDB foundation is production-ready
- PostgreSQL + Redis are now blocking critical booking workflows
- CDN can be activated later without affecting core booking system

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - POSTGRESQL PHASE 1: ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE**

### **Phase 1: Database Infrastructure (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)**
- **‚úÖ Production PostgreSQL Cluster**: Primary (16GB) + Replica (8GB) with auto-tuned configs
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Replication Monitoring**: 15-second critical threshold with automated alerting  
- **‚úÖ PgBackRest Enterprise Backup**: S3 integration replacing basic pg_dump
- **‚úÖ Hybrid PgBouncer Pooling**: Transaction + session modes for ORM compatibility
- **‚úÖ pg_stat_statements Integration**: Query performance tracking and optimization
- **‚úÖ WAL Archiving to S3**: Complete point-in-time recovery capability
- **‚úÖ Disaster Recovery Procedures**: Automated failover testing and validation
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Documentation**: Operational procedures and ORM compatibility guides

---

## üéØ **CURRENT PRIORITY: POSTGRESQL PHASE 2 - BOOKING CORE LOGIC**

### **Focus Shift Rationale**
- **MongoDB**: ‚úÖ Production-ready venue layout management
- **PostgreSQL Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Enterprise cluster with monitoring and backup
- **PostgreSQL Schema**: üöß IN PROGRESS - Booking logic and FSM implementation  
- **Redis**: üö´ Blocking real-time seat locking and conflict resolution
- **Stripe Integration**: üöß IN PROGRESS - Production-grade webhook handling

### **Dependencies**
- Booking system requires PostgreSQL schema AND Redis to function
- Seat locking uses `seatId` from completed MongoDB implementation
- Payment processing needs PostgreSQL transaction safety with enhanced Stripe integration
- Real-time features need Redis TTL and conflict resolution

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING (ACCEPTABLE) TRADEOFFS**

*These are acknowledged and intentional design decisions for Phase 2. Documented to ensure they're not forgotten for future phases.*

### **1. No Split Payouts or Tax Logic Yet**
**Status**: Deferred to Phase 3  
**Rationale**: Fine for launch with single-venue payouts  
**Future Requirement**: Stripe Connect Express will be required when scaling to:
- Multi-party revenue sharing
- International venues with tax implications  
- Complex venue network partnerships

### **2. No UI Support for Draft/Pricing Versions**
**Status**: Backend-ready, frontend pending  
**Rationale**: Core versioning logic implemented, UI can catch up later  
**Future Requirement**: Staging preview interface needed for:
- Venue operators to preview pricing changes
- LML ops team to review event configurations before publish
- A/B testing different pricing strategies

### **3. No Multilingual or Locale-Aware Pricing**
**Status**: Single currency (USD) and English-only for launch  
**Rationale**: Acceptable for initial US market focus  
**Future Requirement**: Consider when scaling to EU/Asia markets:
- Multi-currency pricing display
- Locale-specific tax calculations
- Translated event metadata and categories

**Final Assessment**: *This implementation path is modular, testable, and scalable. Architecture won't require refactors when scaling from 100 events to 100,000.*

## üìã **IMPLEMENTATION QUEUE**

### **IMMEDIATE: PostgreSQL Phase 2 - Booking Core Logic**
1. **‚úÖ Chunk 1 (Days 1-2)**: Flexible core schema with FSM abstraction
2. **üöß Chunk 2 (Days 3-4)**: Enhanced booking FSM + event versioning  
3. **üìã Chunk 3 (Days 5-7)**: Production-grade Stripe integration
4. **üìã API Endpoints**: Complete booking workflow support
5. **üìã Testing & Validation**: Unit, integration, and load tests

### **NEXT: Phase 3 - Redis Performance Layer**
1. **Redis Locking Strategy**: Real-time seat holds with TTL and conflict resolution
2. **Session Management**: User state caching and session storage
3. **Event/Venue Caching**: High-performance data layer
4. **Rate Limiting & Fraud**: Request throttling and anomaly detection
5. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket support for live updates

### **FUTURE: Phase 4 - Production Optimization**
1. **Performance Indexing**: Database optimization for scale
2. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Production observability  
3. **CDN Activation**: Live S3/CloudFront deployment
4. **Multi-Region**: Geographic distribution and failover

### **FUTURE: Phase 5 - Advanced Features**
1. **Reporting Dashboard**: Analytics and business intelligence
2. **Mobile API**: Native app support
3. **Partner Integrations**: Third-party venue management systems
4. **Advanced Pricing**: Dynamic pricing and promotional codes

**COMPLETED**: PostgreSQL Phase 1 - Enterprise infrastructure with monitoring and backup  
**IN PROGRESS**: PostgreSQL Phase 2 - Booking core logic implementation  
**NEXT**: Phase 3 - Redis performance layer for real-time features  
**BLOCKED**: Live ticket sales until PostgreSQL Phase 2 + Redis completion

## üìù **NOTES**

- All MongoDB and PostgreSQL Phase 1 work committed and pushed to GitHub
- Enterprise PostgreSQL cluster ready with:
  - Production monitoring and alerting
  - Enterprise backup with S3 integration
  - Hybrid connection pooling for ORM compatibility
  - Disaster recovery procedures
- Test endpoints validated and working:
  - `/api/v1/test-mongo` - Schema validation with seat IDs
  - `/api/v1/test-immutability` - Full publishing workflow
- Acceptable tradeoffs documented for Phase 2 scope
- Redis gold standard compliance still required for all services
