# 🧠 LML Backend Development Status & Roadmap

## ✅ **COMPLETED - PHASE 1 & 2: MONGODB FOUNDATION**

### **Phase 1: Schema & Validation (COMPLETED ✅)**
- **✅ Deterministic Seat IDs**: SHA-256 hashes (`layoutId_section_row_number`)
- **✅ Coordinate System**: Normalized 0-1 x,y coordinates for rendering
- **✅ Layout Classification**: `seated`, `standing`, `hybrid` types  
- **✅ Viewport Metadata**: Canvas configuration with units (`relative` | `px`)
- **✅ MongoDB JSON Schema**: Database-level validation and constraints
- **✅ TypeScript Types**: Production-grade type safety with enums

### **Phase 2: Immutability & Publishing (COMPLETED ✅)**
- **✅ Hash Validation**: Prevents silent mutations between publish and deploy
- **✅ Status Workflow**: `draft → published → deployed` with enforcement
- **✅ CDN Publishing**: Mock implementation ready for S3/CloudFront
- **✅ Automated Backups**: Pre-publish and pre-deploy with retention policies
- **✅ Immutability Guards**: Published/deployed layouts fully protected
- **✅ Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with detailed violation reporting

## ⏸️ **PAUSED: CDN INTEGRATION**

### **What's Ready But Paused**
- **CDN Publisher**: Full mock implementation in `publishing/cdn-publisher.ts`
- **S3/CloudFront Integration**: Architecture complete, awaiting live implementation
- **Signed URLs**: Mock generation ready for production
- **Cache Invalidation**: Strategy defined but not implemented
- **Global Distribution**: Framework ready for multi-region deployment

### **Why Paused**
- MongoDB foundation is production-ready
- PostgreSQL + Redis are now blocking critical booking workflows
- CDN can be activated later without affecting core booking system

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT PRIORITY: PHASE 3 - TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM**

### **Focus Shift Rationale**
- **MongoDB**: ✅ Production-ready venue layout management
- **PostgreSQL**: 🚫 Blocking booking, payment, user management  
- **Redis**: 🚫 Blocking real-time seat locking and conflict resolution
- **Stripe Integration**: 🚫 Blocking payment processing and payouts

### **Dependencies**
- Booking system requires both PostgreSQL AND Redis to function
- Seat locking uses `seatId` from completed MongoDB implementation
- Payment processing needs PostgreSQL transaction safety
- Real-time features need Redis TTL and conflict resolution

---

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION QUEUE**

### **IMMEDIATE: Phase 3 - MVP Booking Infrastructure**
1. **PostgreSQL Schema Design**: Users, bookings, payments, audit trail
2. **Redis Locking Strategy**: Seat holds with TTL and conflict resolution  
3. **Finite State Machine**: Booking state transitions with validation
4. **Stripe Integration**: Payment processing and venue payouts
5. **API Endpoints**: Complete booking workflow support
6. **Anti-Fraud System**: Edge case handling and audit trail

### **FUTURE: Phase 4 - Production Optimization**
1. **Performance Indexing**: Database optimization for scale
2. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Production observability  
3. **CDN Activation**: Live S3/CloudFront deployment
4. **Multi-Region**: Geographic distribution and failover

### **FUTURE: Phase 5 - Advanced Features**
1. **Reporting Dashboard**: Analytics and business intelligence
2. **Mobile API**: Native app support
3. **Partner Integrations**: Third-party venue management systems
4. **Advanced Pricing**: Dynamic pricing and promotional codes

---

## 🔄 **CURRENT STATUS**

**COMPLETED**: MongoDB venue layout system (production-ready)  
**IN PROGRESS**: PostgreSQL + Redis booking system planning  
**NEXT**: Implementation approval and execution of Phase 3  
**BLOCKED**: Live ticket sales until Phase 3 completion

## 📝 **NOTES**

- All MongoDB work is committed and pushed to GitHub
- Test endpoints validated and working:
  - `/api/v1/test-mongo` - Schema validation with seat IDs
  - `/api/v1/test-immutability` - Full publishing workflow
- CDN integration can be resumed post-Phase 3 with minimal effort
- Redis gold standard compliance still required for all services

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Next Review**: Post Phase 3 planning approval
