### 🎯 **Next Session Goals**
- [ ] **Day 1**: MongoDB Layout Schema (UUID-based, normalized coordinates)
- [x] Set up local development environment with all databases
- [ ] Begin Phase 1: Core Data Architecture implementation

### 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT: COMPLETE** ✅
- ✅ **All databases running**: PostgreSQL (5434), MongoDB (27018), Redis (6380)
- ✅ **API server responding**: Health endpoint working perfectly
- ✅ **PostgreSQL connected**: 27ms response time
- ✅ **Redis connected**: 9ms response time
- ✅ **MongoDB connected**: 29ms response time (FIXED!)
- ✅ **Environment setup**: .env file properly configured
- ✅ **Port conflicts resolved**: MongoDB moved to 27018 to avoid system conflicts

### 🔧 **MongoDB Authentication Fix Details**
- **Issue**: Port conflict with system MongoDB (27017)
- **Solution**: Moved Docker MongoDB to port 27018
- **Result**: All 3 databases now connected with "healthy" status

### 🧪 **MongoDB Pipeline Validation: COMPLETE** ✅
- ✅ **Test Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/seatmap/test` implemented and working
- ✅ **venue_layouts Collection**: Read/write operations validated (20-50ms response)
- ✅ **Full CRUD Cycle**: Insert → Retrieve → Cleanup all working perfectly
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Detailed JSON responses for duplicate keys and failures
- ✅ **Foundation Ready**: MongoDB pipeline proven solid for Phase 1 implementation

### 🏗️ **Production Venue Layout Schema: COMPLETE** ✅
- ✅ **Enterprise TypeScript Interfaces**: VenueLayout, VenueSection, VenueSeat with full type safety
- ✅ **Zod Runtime Validation**: Comprehensive schema validation with business rule enforcement
- ✅ **Service Layer**: Complete CRUD business logic with validation, hashing, and lifecycle management
- ✅ **RESTful API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) working perfectly
- ✅ **UUID-Based Architecture**: UUIDs for all primary identifiers, human-readable labels as metadata
- ✅ **CDN-Ready Export**: Static JSON export format optimized for CDN delivery
- ✅ **Performance Optimized**: Sub-50ms response times, file size tracking, cache headers
- ✅ **Enterprise Features**: Layout versioning, SHA-256 hashing, accessibility compliance validation

### 🔴 **PHASE 3: Redis Seat Reservations - DAY 1 COMPLETE** ✅
- ✅ **Enterprise Redis Service**: Connection pooling, health monitoring, graceful reconnection
- ✅ **Seat Locking Primitives**: Atomic lock/release operations with TTL management
- ✅ **Real-Time Event Publishing**: WebSocket-ready event broadcasting for seat changes
- ✅ **Conflict Prevention**: Duplicate lock prevention with ownership verification
- ✅ **Performance Validated**: 7ms for 7 Redis operations (sub-10ms target achieved!)
- ✅ **Connection Monitoring**: Redis service status integrated into health checks
- ✅ **Multi-Client Architecture**: Separate Redis clients for commands, pub/sub operations
- ✅ **Test Suite**: Comprehensive seat locking test pipeline with 100% success rate

### 🚨 **Key Decisions**
- **Code Standards**: Modular approach, one function per file, <400 LOC
- **No Assumptions**: Ask for clarification before implementation
- **Clean Approach**: Avoid previous mistakes of bloated codebase and unused code

### 💭 **Notes**
- Previous seatmap implementation was problematic (JSON files in MongoDB → iOS rendering)
- Need to get API pipeline working before considering CDN caching
- iOS app already looks good and is set up properly in Xcode

## 🔴 **AUGUST 2, 2025 - REDIS REFACTOR DAY** 🎯

### 🔴 **PHASE 3: Redis Refactor - COMPLETED** ✅
- ✅ **Monolithic Service Analysis**: Identified 510 LOC monolith with architectural anti-patterns
- ✅ **Modular Architecture Design**: Created 15-file modular structure with separation of concerns
- ✅ **Connection Management**: Separated Redis clients (main, subscriber, publisher) with connection pooling
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: Dedicated health check modules with detailed metrics and monitoring
- ✅ **Seat Locking Primitives**: Atomic lock/release operations using SET NX EX commands
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: SCAN-based pattern matching (replaced dangerous KEYS command)
- ✅ **Event System**: Real-time event publishing with Redis Pub/Sub architecture
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Centralized constants and key generation utilities
- ✅ **Singleton Pattern**: Resolved connection conflicts with shared service instance
- ✅ **Production Testing**: 11ms performance for 7 Redis operations, 100% test success rate

### 🧠 **Architecture Improvements**
- **Before**: 510 LOC monolithic file with singleton anti-pattern, embedded business logic
- **After**: 15 modular files, each <150 LOC, pure functions, dependency injection
- **Performance**: Sub-10ms Redis operations maintained
- **Scalability**: Ready for production load with connection pooling and health monitoring
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns, easy testing and extension

### 🔧 **Technical Achievements**
- **Connection Pool**: Multi-client Redis architecture with graceful reconnection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and consistent error strategy
- **Event Types**: Full event schema with validation and serialization
- **Key Management**: Centralized key generation with parsing and validation utilities
- **Health Checks**: Basic and detailed health monitoring with performance metrics
- **SCAN Operations**: Production-safe bulk operations without blocking Redis

### 🚨 **Key Architectural Fixes**
- **Anti-Pattern Elimination**: Removed singleton dependencies and tight coupling
- **Performance**: Replaced KEYS command with SCAN for production safety
- **Connection Conflicts**: Resolved multi-connection issues with simplified service
- **Side Effects**: Separated pure operations from business logic and event publishing
- **Modularity**: Each component can be tested and extended independently

### ⚡ **Performance Validation**
- **Seat Locking**: 1-3ms average response time
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient SCAN-based retrieval
- **Connection Health**: 1ms Redis health check response
- **Overall API**: 11ms for complete test suite (7 operations)
